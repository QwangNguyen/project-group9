Envite is project dedicated to visualizing individual carbon footprints. Users have the ability to calculate the amount of CO2 they generate each year by inputting their daily habits. This data can then be converted to different metrics depending on the users desires. Furthermore users have the option to create an account to track their progress to see if their lifestyle changes are leading to a greener tomorrow.
